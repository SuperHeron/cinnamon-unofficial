SUMMARY="Sass for Python: A straightforward binding of libsass for Python."
DESCRIPTION="
This package provides a simple Python extension module sass which is binding LibSass (written in
C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung). It’s very straightforward and there isn’t any headache
related to Python distribution/deployment. That means you can add just libsass into your
setup.py’s install_requires list or requirements.txt file.
